      "Write what hurts, but also write what heals. Someone needs both your scars and your light.",
      "A lyric is not just a rhyme, itâ€™s a heartbeat hidden between words. Keep writing, someone is listening.",
      "Donâ€™t fear small sentences. Even three words can change a life: I forgive you.",
      "Every word you write is a seed. Some grow today, some grow years later â€” plant anyway.",
      "Perfection kills creativity. Let your pen bleed freely; the world needs raw honesty, not polished silence.",
      "Your pain doesnâ€™t define you â€” but your ability to turn it into art does.",
      "Writers are time-travelers. Your words today will speak to someone decades from now.",
      "A blank page isnâ€™t empty; itâ€™s just waiting for you to breathe into it.",
      "Write for the one person who understands you, not the million who judge you.",
      "Even if you think nobody reads your words, remember: you read them first, and you matter.",
      "A poem is not written, itâ€™s felt. The pen is only the translator of your soul.",
      "The world doesnâ€™t need another perfect story; it needs your imperfect truth.",
      "Lyrics are just conversations that learned how to sing.",
      "Every heartbreak, every silence, every tear â€” theyâ€™re all ink waiting for your paper.",
      "Donâ€™t compare your chapter 1 with someone elseâ€™s chapter 20. Keep writing.",
      "One sentence can hold more power than an entire book, if it comes from the heart.",
      "Writing is proof you existed. Long after youâ€™re gone, your words will stay alive.",
      "Even unfinished poems whisper something. Donâ€™t throw them away.",
      "You are not just writing words; you are leaving footprints of your soul.",
      "When inspiration doesnâ€™t come, write anyway. The act of writing creates its own muse.",
      "Not every writer gets famous, but every writer touches someone unseen.",
      "Ink remembers what the heart tries to forget. Keep writing, itâ€™s therapy disguised as art.",
      "Your small lines today may become someoneâ€™s favorite verse tomorrow.",
      "Writing isnâ€™t about big words; itâ€™s about big feelings in simple words.",
      "The best stories are the ones you were afraid to write. Start there.",
      "Even silence has a voice â€” learn to write it down.",
      "A lyricist is a thief of emotions â€” borrowing from life and giving it back as music.",
      "Donâ€™t wait for the perfect time to write. The perfect time is when you feel something.",
      "Your notebook is your safest friend â€” it never interrupts, it just listens.",
      "The truest audience is yourself. If your writing heals you, it will heal someone else too.",
      "A pen is just a small tool that opens up the largest rooms in your heart.",
      "Your words are the only architecture that lasts. Build something true with them.",
      "We don't just write what we see, we write how it felt to see it.",
      "The lyricist's job is to give people the words for the feelings they already had.",
      "Don't censor the messy middle. That's where the most human and honest art lives.",
      "The greatest stories are already inside you. Writing is simply the process of reading them aloud to the world.",
      "Every poem you finish is a small act of conquering the chaos of your own mind.",
      "Your notebook isn't just paper; itâ€™s a time capsule holding the past and predicting the future.",
      "Stop chasing perfection. Start chasing the raw, necessary truth in your first draft.",
      "The unseen ink of effort matters more than the visible fame. Keep showing up.",
      "Write the difficult conversation you can't have in real life. The page can handle it.",
      "A writer is someone who never truly lets a moment die. They keep it alive in ink.",
      "Let your words be bridges, not walls. Connect to others through shared vulnerability."
