      "Write what hurts, but also write what heals. Someone needs both your scars and your light.",
      "A lyric is not just a rhyme, it’s a heartbeat hidden between words. Keep writing, someone is listening.",
      "Don’t fear small sentences. Even three words can change a life: I forgive you.",
      "Every word you write is a seed. Some grow today, some grow years later — plant anyway.",
      "Perfection kills creativity. Let your pen bleed freely; the world needs raw honesty, not polished silence.",
      "Your pain doesn’t define you — but your ability to turn it into art does.",
      "Writers are time-travelers. Your words today will speak to someone decades from now.",
      "A blank page isn’t empty; it’s just waiting for you to breathe into it.",
      "Write for the one person who understands you, not the million who judge you.",
      "Even if you think nobody reads your words, remember: you read them first, and you matter.",
      "A poem is not written, it’s felt. The pen is only the translator of your soul.",
      "The world doesn’t need another perfect story; it needs your imperfect truth.",
      "Lyrics are just conversations that learned how to sing.",
      "Every heartbreak, every silence, every tear — they’re all ink waiting for your paper.",
      "Don’t compare your chapter 1 with someone else’s chapter 20. Keep writing.",
      "One sentence can hold more power than an entire book, if it comes from the heart.",
      "Writing is proof you existed. Long after you’re gone, your words will stay alive.",
      "Even unfinished poems whisper something. Don’t throw them away.",
      "You are not just writing words; you are leaving footprints of your soul.",
      "When inspiration doesn’t come, write anyway. The act of writing creates its own muse.",
      "Not every writer gets famous, but every writer touches someone unseen.",
      "Ink remembers what the heart tries to forget. Keep writing, it’s therapy disguised as art.",
      "Your small lines today may become someone’s favorite verse tomorrow.",
      "Writing isn’t about big words; it’s about big feelings in simple words.",
      "The best stories are the ones you were afraid to write. Start there.",
      "Even silence has a voice — learn to write it down.",
      "A lyricist is a thief of emotions — borrowing from life and giving it back as music.",
      "Don’t wait for the perfect time to write. The perfect time is when you feel something.",
      "Your notebook is your safest friend — it never interrupts, it just listens.",
      "The truest audience is yourself. If your writing heals you, it will heal someone else too."
